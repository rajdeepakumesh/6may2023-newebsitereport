    <h1 id="a1">India's economic growth ‘natural by-product’ of 9 years of stability: PM Modi</h1>
    <img src="./img/1.png">
    <p> In an exclusive interview with PTI late last week, the prime minister also stressed on the need for timely and clear communication of policy stance by central banks, and policy actions by each country in their fight against inflation so that it can prevent negative repercussions on others countries.

        While most advanced economies are facing an economic slowdown, chronic shortages, high inflation, and ageing populations, the Indian economy is acknowledged to be the fastest-growing large economy with the largest youth population.
        
        "For a long time in world history, India was one of the top economies of the world. Later, due to the impact of colonisation of various kinds, our global footprint was reduced," he said.
        
        "But now, India is again on the rise. The speed with which we jumped five spots, from the 10th largest economy to the fifth largest in less than a decade has conveyed the fact that India means business," he noted.</p>
        <p>Adding a fourth 'D' - development - to the 3Ds of democracy, demography and diversity, he said the period till 2047 is one of huge opportunity and "Indians who are living in this era have a great chance to lay a foundation for growth that will be remembered for the next thousand years."

            India's USD 3.39 trillion GDP overtook that of the UK in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, making it the fifth-largest economy in the world behind the US, China, Japan and Germany.
            
            In the three decades before 2014, Modi said, the country saw many governments that were unstable and therefore, unable to get much done.
            
            "But in the last few years, the people have given a decisive mandate [to BJP], which has led to a stable government, predictable policies and clarity in the overall direction," he said. "This stability is the reason that over the past nine years, several reforms were brought in."
            
             </p>
             <p> These reforms, related to the economy, education, financial sector, banks, digitalisation, welfare, inclusion and social sector, have laid a strong foundation, and “growth is a natural by-product,” he said. The rapid and sustained progress made by India has evoked interest across the world and many countries have been “watching our growth story very closely.”

                "They are convinced that this progress is not an accident but is happening as a result of a clear, action-oriented roadmap of 'Reform, Perform, Transform'," he said.
                
                "For a long time, India was perceived as a nation of over one billion hungry stomachs. But now, India is being seen as a nation of over one billion aspirational minds, more than two billion skilled hands, and hundreds of millions of young people," he said.</p>
